KEY NOTES ABOUR GAMEPLAY

- Game is initialized with 5 waves of monsters, each adding +1 monster to the upcoming wave.
  Example: First wave has 1 monster, second has 2, etc.

- Wave number, countdown, time between waves, time between monsters, monster health, hit point (damage)
  and many attribute can be adjusted through parameters.

- At each wave, user gains 1 extra tower to place. Button will be inactive after all possible number of towers
  are constructed.

- At the very first wave (at the game start), user can build 2 towers.

- Towers are placed randomly on tiles that are eligible to build a tower. Eligible tiles are the ones that are
  located roadside.
  Example: If a tile and road has a common side, that tile is a possible location for a new tower.

- The game ends in two ways:
  1) If a monster make it to the final destination 
  2) If all the possible waves (5 waves by default) are eliminated. For simplicity, game ends when the number 
  of monsters killed is equal to 15, which is the number of total monsters for 5 waves (1+2+3+4+5).

WHAT CAN BE IMPROVED OR ADDED?

- Rather than a tower, a turret rotating and pointing monsters can be added.
- Different new types of towers can be added.
- Extra levels, paths, maps can be added.
- Round number can be added at the top of the screen for user to track his record.
- New textures, tiles, backgrounds can be added.
